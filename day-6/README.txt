Could solve part 1, but with part 2 stumbled upon an issue: since we need to preserve element positioning and build numbers according to their positions vertically, code from p1 is no longer viable within this context - I'd need to increase complexity gradually by throwing in bunch of functions and working with raw string somehow, which is what I did, but in the end it resulted into un-evenly splitted elements (ex. column with max width of 4 started producing elements like 4.45 or 0..2 with my code), so bunch of code needs to be rewritten in order to follow length of operations + whitespaces after them (which, according to example in task to part 2, splits elements evenly), and I'm just too lazy for that after doing what I did.

So, roughly for part 2: need evenly splitted elements, replace whitespaces of those elements with some symbol, after whole building iteration (the vertical string builder) replace this symbol with 0-length string (get rid of all it's repeats); convert the resulted strings and perform operations.
